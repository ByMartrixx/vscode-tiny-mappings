# Tiny Mappings for VSCode

Syntax highlighting for mapping files. This is only for prettier looking files - instead of looking like plain text - and should not be used for mapping file edition. For that, you can use [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma).

## Features
- Syntax highlighting on Tiny V2 Mapping files (`.tiny` extension)
- Syntax highlighting on Enigma Mapping files (`.mapping` extension)

## Planed features
- ~~Error checking on `.tiny` and `.mapping` files~~ Cancelled. Edition of mapping files should not be done manually! (Didn't know  when I made this)
